### HELP THE WHEELS FELL OFF

*If the wheels fall off, don't forget to make the script executable!*

`chmod +x UpdateAll.sh`

### No External IP Address?

Hmmm, Amazon has closed it's doors? Update the IP check from https://checkip.amazonaws.com to an alternative location.

### Mac OS?
You are unfortunately missing a few key features from `grep`!

Update `grep` with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh "Brew") üòá

```
brew install grep --with-default-names
grep --version
grep (GNU grep) 3.1
Packaged by Homebrew
```

Give it another whirl üëå
